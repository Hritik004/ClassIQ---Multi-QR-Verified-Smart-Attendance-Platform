## 🧠 Project Overview

**ClassIQ** is an intelligent attendance management platform built with **Flask** and **MySQL**, designed to eliminate manual roll calls and prevent proxy attendance.

The system generates **dynamic multi-QR codes** for each session so students cannot reuse, screenshot, or share codes. It integrates secure login, session control, and real-time tracking to deliver a reliable, tamper-proof attendance mechanism for academic environments.
